    /// @brief The class used to interpolate based on averaging
    ///
    /// The averaging interpolation operates on three specific \ref Mesh::Location - Faces
    /// (m_facesMassCenters), Nodes, and Edges(m_edgesCenters). The idea is to
    /// collect all samples close to the locations and perform a mathematical
    /// operation on their values. The \ref Method enum describes available operations.
    ///
    /// The algorithm operates as follow:
    ///
    /// -   The samples are ordered in an RTree for a fast search
    ///
    /// -   The search area around the location is constructed as follow:
    ///
    ///     1.  For face locations, the sample areas correspond to the faces,
    ///         increased/decreased by the relativeSearchRadius parameter
    ///         (relativeSearchRadius > 1 increased, relativeSearchRadius < 1
    ///         decreased).
    ///
    ///     2.  For \ref Mesh::Location Nodes and \ref Mesh::Location Edges locations, the dual face around the node is
    ///         constructed by connecting the mid-points of all edges connected
    ///         to the node. As above, the resulting polygon can be
    ///         increased/decreased by the relativeSearchRadius parameter.
    ///
    /// -   The search radius is computed from the constructed polygon nodes and
    ///     the locations, the maximum value is taken.
    ///
    /// -   The sample RTree is inquired to retrieve the indices of the samples
    ///     within the search radius.
    ///
    /// -   The operations described above are executed on the found samples.
    ///
    /// -   For the \ref Mesh::Location Edges location, the interpolated values at the node are
    ///     averaged.
