    /// @brief A class used for triangulation interpolation
    ///
    /// As for averaging, the triangle interpolation operates at three specific
    /// \ref Location - Faces, Nodes, and Edges.
    /// Only the values at the nodes of the identified triangle are used in
    /// the computation of each location.
    /// The algorithm operates as follow:
    ///
    /// - The triangulation of the samples is computed
    ///
    /// - For each triangle, the circumcenter is computed
    ///
    /// - The triangle circumcenters are ordered in an RTree for a fast search
    ///
    /// - For each location, the closest circumcenter is found
    ///
    /// - If the corresponding triangle contains the location then the linear
    ///   interpolation is performed, otherwise, the next neighbouring
    ///   triangle is searched. The next neighbouring triangle is the first
    ///   triangle that satisfies these two conditions:
    ///
    ///   1.  shares one of the current triangle edges.
    ///
    ///   2.  the crossing of the edge and the line connecting the location
    ///       the current triangle circumcenter exists.
    ///
    /// - If the next triangle does not contain the location, repeat the step
    ///   above for a maximum number of times equal to two times the number of
    ///   triangles.
    ///
    /// When a triangle enclosing a specific location is not found, the
    /// interpolated value at that location is invalid. The handling of
    /// spherical accurate projection occurs at low-level geometrical functions
    /// (\ref IsPointInPolygonNodes, \ref AreSegmentsCrossing). Therefore, the algorithm is
    /// independent of the implementation details that occur at the level of the
    /// geometrical functions.
